# Personal Interactive Portfolio Landing Page
This landing page serves as an interactive and dynamic portfolio experience, designed to showcase content in an engaging and accessible manner.

Key Features:
Multilingual Support: The site is available in three languages, offering a broader reach and improved user experience for a diverse audience.

Dynamic "Windows": Content is presented within interactive "windows" that are not static images. This allows for greater flexibility, responsiveness, and potential for dynamic content loading.

Enhanced Accessibility: All interactive elements on the screen feature visible focus indicators, ensuring a more accessible experience for users navigating with keyboards or assistive technologies.

Randomized Content Display: Upon refreshing the page, items appear in randomized positions on the screen, providing a fresh and unpredictable layout with each visit.

Draggable Elements (Desktop): For desktop users, both individual content items and the interactive "windows" are draggable, allowing for personalized arrangement and exploration of the layout. (This feature is currently exclusive to desktop environments.)

Resizable Windows: The content "windows" are resizable, giving users control over their viewing experience and enabling them to adjust the layout to their preference.

Interactive Footer Links: The footer includes links with hover effects, providing clear visual feedback and enhancing navigability.
